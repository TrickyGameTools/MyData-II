![Project Discontinued](https://github.com/TrickyGameTools/MyData-Mono/assets/11202073/94e83ef8-b320-48c7-8a38-91ee4cc6098c)

The reason this time?
I want to get out of the .NET as soon as possible.
It's not that I hate C#, as it seemed perfect for project such as these. It's just that I heard too many stuff that I don't like!
This project will be replaced by MyData III which will use the Slyvina framework and June19.
Far from ideal for a tool such as this, but a safer route for everybody to go in the end.

I'm sorry!

MyData III will, by the way be added to the Slyvina repos, soon.

# MyData-II

MyData II is a very extremely simplistic database program set up for usage in game projects.
It is basically an enhanched version of the first "MyData" program which will be deprecated as soon as MyData II is finished.
Now the older .mydata files should be fully compatible with the MyData II. MyData II will however contain features not supported by MyData, meaning that MyData II files may not be compatible with MyData.

# Status

Alpha - The program SHOULD work, but bugs are very likely and some features may not yet have been fully implemented.
