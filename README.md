# MyData-II

MyData II is a very extremely simplistic database program set up for usage in game projects.
It is basically an enhanched version of the first "MyData" program which will be deprecated as soon as MyData II is finished.
Now the older .mydata files should be fully compatible with the MyData II. MyData II will however contain features not supported by MyData, meaning that MyData II files may not be compatible with MyData.

# Status

WIP - The project is NOT yet finished. Some very crucial parts are NOT yet operative (like saving to name an important one).
